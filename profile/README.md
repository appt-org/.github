# Appt Foundation

The mission of the Appt Foundation is to make apps accessible for everyone.

We try to achieve this by sharing free content and open-source code.

## Appt.org

[Appt.org](https://appt.org) is a website where you can learn how to build accessible apps. The website contains hundreds of articles and code samples for Android, iOS, Flutter, .NET MAUI, React Native and Xamarin.
